        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        Want to really wow folks at your next Octoberfest party? 
        Treat them to homemade soft pretzels!
        They're easier than you think. 
        With a little boiling, and a little baking, 
        you can quickly churn out fresh warm pretzels 
        that taste far better than the store-bought kind. 
        Now all you need is the mustard.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 c. warm water (110° to 115°F)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25-ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 c. all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled, plus more for work surface</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/3 c. baking soda</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly grease a bowl. 
                Combine water and brown sugar in a separate bowl. 
                Sprinkle yeast over top and stir to combine. 
                Let stand until foamy, 4 to 6 minutes 
                (if mixture doesn’t foam, discard and start again). 
                Add flour, butter, and kosher salt. 
                Beat on low speed with an electric mixer 
                with a dough hook attached just until combined. 
                Increase speed to medium and beat until 
                dough is smooth and slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Transfer to prepared bowl. 
                Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise until 
                doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 equal pieces; 
                let rest for 5 minutes. 
                On a lightly floured work surface, 
                form each piece of dough into an 18-inch rope 
                and mold into a U-shape. 
                Twist ends over each other once or twice, 
                then fold down toward U-shape and tuck under dough, 
                forming a pretzel. </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. 
                Lightly grease two rimmed baking sheets. 
                Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. 
                Stir in baking soda. Working one at a time, 
                cook without flipping, 30 seconds; transfer, top sides up, 
                to prepared baking sheets. 
                Brush with egg and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.</li>
            <li>Bake, in batches, until golden brown, 
                12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. 
                Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
