        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            One of my all-time favorite comfort foods is <em>fried rice</em>. 
            Whenever I make white rice, I make extra, 
            just so I can have the leftovers for fried rice. 
            Plain cooked rice is tasty enough, 
            but when it's fried the grains get all crispy and seared.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. canola oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>3 scallions or green onions, chopped, whites and green separated</li>
            <li>2 medium or 3 small carrots, diced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 c. frozen peas, defrosted</li>
            <li>4 c. cold rice</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce</li>

        </ul>

            <li>Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Add eggs and cook, stirring, 
                until curds are light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes, 
                transfer to a plate. 
                Add bacon to skillet and cook until crisp, 
                5 to 6 minutes.</li>

                and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 
                5 to 6 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook 
                until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add peas and rice. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through,

                soy sauce and sesame oil.
